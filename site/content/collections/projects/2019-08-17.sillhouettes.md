description: '<p>This book publishes a series of poems by a young poet, Kirsten Ockerse. The poems were a series of autobiographic observations. The first poem, Dressing Up, reflects her experience as a young child playing with her sister Eerin and friends in the attic. The sub-set called Silhouettes, were a series of poems from the times during her college years at Northwestern University. El Abuelo is a poem to pay homage to her grandfather, Al Florence. Since the poems reflect an autobiographic perspective, as “silhouettes” by the author, their sub-series by that name are all designed in typographic forms that represent the letters of the poet’s first name—hence, adding meaning to the poems reading experience. The booklet, posthumously published after her fatal accident in 1989, was primarily meant for those who knew Kirsten. An unnumbered edition of 24 pages, 19.7 x 27.5 cm, printed offset on Mohawk Superfine paper, with each book signed by the designer.</p>'
