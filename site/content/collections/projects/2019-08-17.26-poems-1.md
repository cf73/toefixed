description: '<p>This bookwork presents the twenty-six letters of the (Latin) alphabet, each conceived as a concrete poem. These poems were originally produced for Dana Ashley’s 1971 Space Trunk Mail Art Exhibition at the California College of Arts and Crafts. Tom contributed by mailing one letter of the alphabet each day during the exhibit’s first 26 days. For this bookwork each letter-poem was reproduced faithfully to the originals, with black parts printed offset, then adding color, cutouts, folds, fragments, tip-ins, etc. by hand. This edition also adds a new concrete poem, also based on the “alphabet” theme, uniquely produced for this bookwork. A limited boxed edition of 150 numbered copies, of 27 plates plus cover, 16 x 16 cm., each edition signed by the author.<br></p>'
