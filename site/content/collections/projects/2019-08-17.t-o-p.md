description: '<p>This is a boxed set of 50 concrete poems from the period 1967-70. It has four groups of works: poems of typographic structures in two and three dimensions; a set of poems as verbivisual drawings; a set of poems of found postage stamps with their cancellations, plus a series of collages using cancelled postage stamps; and found postcards transformed into visual poems. The distinguished Danish poet Vagn Steen, known for his work in concrete poetry, wrote an introduction to this body of work along with his expanded views into the nature of concrete and visual poetry. This boxed set of 500 numbered copies has 60 pages, 21.5 x 28 cm., printed offset in black on Louvain Supreme paper, with some pages involving tip-ins and foldouts, and the first four poems silkscreened in color.<br></p>'
