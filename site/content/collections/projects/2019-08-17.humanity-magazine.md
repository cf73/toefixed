description: '<p>In 1987 Tony Balis established The Humanity Foundation (THF), later changed to The Humanity Initiative. With THF’s mission to encourage people to understand this planet as our common home, and to start “a conversation with the world”. THF commenced the publishing of HUMANITY MAGAZINE. Three issues were produced: the Preview Issue, 1991; the Premiere Issue, July 1996; the Second Issue, July 1997. Tom Ockerse became an integral partner in this effort with Balis and primarily responsible for formulating the magazine’s design principles and its “visual voice.” These issues have won many awards, for its design and production excellence, as well as for other aspects. While copies of these three issues of HUMANITY MAGAZINE ran out years ago, some remain available from TOE—but only as a set of these three issues. <i>Note: in addition &nbsp;to your purchase of these three issues you will receive a set of the Humanity Postcards for free.</i><br></p>'
