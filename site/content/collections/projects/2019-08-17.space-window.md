description: '<p>A collection of 44 postcards conceived as an original bookwork that documentraces* a church in Newport, RI, claimed as “America’s first electrified church.” The cards were part of an art contribution to the 1977 SPACE WINDOW exhibition and symposium event held at Brown University and Rhode Island School of Design. Each card is part of a chance-operating system that combines a photographic fragment from the church connecting with a word on the reverse side with a punched hole in the card for their interactive poetic experience. A limited edition of 300 numbered copies of 44 postcards in a paper sleeve; 10 x 14.5 cm, printed offset in black on white stock.<br></p>'
