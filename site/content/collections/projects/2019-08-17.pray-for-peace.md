description: '<p>In 1971, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, asked Tom to submit a verbivisual poem for MoMA as a Christmas card in 1971. Tom used one of his found postal stamps with its cancelation, which MoMA published on a card 15 x 15 cm. Tom received a small number for his personal use. There are still a few left over from this collection, of special interest to collectors of concrete poetry from that period. The author signed each card in this private set, and it comes with an envelope.<br></p>'
