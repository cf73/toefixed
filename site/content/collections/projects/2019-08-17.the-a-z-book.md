description: '<p>This book, first produced in 1965 as a limited edition of 25 silkscreened copies, uses die-cuts pages to offers an unfolding experience of concrete poetry from its letters revealed out of new relationships. Consequently the book became a natural part in numerous international exhibitions on “concrete poetry” and “bookworks.” Colorcraft-Brussel Publishing Company (CBPC*) reproduced and boxed an exact copy of the original book for an unnumbered offset edition. It won the AIGA’s 50 Best Books Award in 1971. This unnumbered edition by CBPC (Lib. of Congress Card Nr: 74-101307), has fifty pages, 28 x 28 cm., printed black on white Mohawk Superfine stock, bound with a plastic comb binder.<br></p>'
