about_tom_text: '<p>Dutch born Tom Ockerse is an American designer/poet/teacher known worldwide for his design and experiments which he broadly termed language art works. His inspirations started in the 1960s, from his direct contacts with people like Dieter Roth, Emmett Williams, Dick Higgins and others working in the spirit of the intermedia arts (cf. Higgins) that sought to erase the conventional boundaries of all the arts.</p><p>This principle continued into Tomâ€™s full-time teaching at Indiana University (1967-71), and at the Rhode Island School of Design (1971-2018). Tom is especially known for his open-minded approach to illuminate the mechanisms of meaning, systems thinking and experimentation with the making of visual communication objects for interaction as something worth experiencing.</p><p>TEST CHANGE</p>'
